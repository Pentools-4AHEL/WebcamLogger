# WebcamLogger

This is a little python script to log your webcam activity in the background.
It's written for windows and only works if you have at least one webcam ;)

YOU MUST NOT USE THIS FOR ANY ILLEGAL ACT. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT IS CAUSED BY THIS SCRIPT!

## Requirements:

- Python 3.*
- packages from requirements.txt

Install python packages:
``` sh
pip install -f requirements.txt
```

## Usage

``` sh
python WebcamTest.py [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-f FPS_COUNT] [-c CODEC]
```

By default it logs to the file: log.avi with 60 fps and MJPG Codec.

## Have fun!
